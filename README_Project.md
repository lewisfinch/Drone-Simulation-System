# CSCI 3081 Project - Drone Simulation System

At the end of this project, you will be able to simulate the behavior of the drone and robots. You will be able to set the pickup location and the final destination of the robot, and afterward the drone will come and pick up the robot toward their destination. Not only the transportation simulation but you will be able to decide what to do with the robot's behavior when the passenger arrived at ther destination or if the drone is too late to pickup.

This directory contains the support code needed to visualize the drone simulation system.

  <li>  <code>README.md</code>
  <li>  <code>.gitignore</code>
  <li>  <code>app</code> folder, which contains:
    <ul>
      <li>  <code>graph_viewer</code> : producing graph visualization
      <li>  <code>transit_service</code> : visualization
    </ul>
  <li>  <code>libs</code> folder, which contains:

      <li>  <code>routing</code> : finding the paths
      <li>  <code>trainsit</code> : entities properties
    </ul>
  <li>  <code>dependencies</code>
</ul>

## Getting Started

Here is a quick overview of how to run the visualization (If you are using ssh, navigate to ssh category below):

    ```bash
    # Go to the project directory
    cd /path/to/repo/project
    
    # Build the project
    make -j
    
    # Run the project (./build/web-app <port> <web folder>)
    ./build/bin/transit_service 8081 apps/transit_service/web/
    ```
    
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081 and you should see a visualization.

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081/schedule.html and you should see a page to schedule the trips.

*Note: 8081 will depends on what port you used. If you use port 8082, then it will be http://127.0.0.1:8082 instead.*

# Simulation

## Schedule
You will be able to schedule the robots for a ride in this page http://127.0.0.1:8081/schedule.html. 

Type passenger name, select start and end destination, and press `Schedule Trip` button to schedule a trip. 

Now go to 3D Visualization page and select the view of the entities on top right corner.

## 3D Visualization
You will be able to watch the simulation of the drone and the passenger here http://127.0.0.1:8081.

On top right corner, you can change your camera view into locking the entities.


# Build and run in different environments

## Getting Started using SSH onto CSE Lab machines

**Important: You have to start the ssh clean if you would like to use the commands below. This means, if you are currently using vscode and already login via ssh, then you cannot run the commands below.**

1. SSH into a CSE Lab Machine using **port forwarding** for the UI

   **Note:** If port `8081` is not available, choose a different port (e.g. 8082, 8083, etc...)

    ```bash
    ssh -L 8081:127.0.0.1:8081 x500@csel-xxxx.cselabs.umn.edu
    ```
    
    Example:
    ```bash
    ssh -L 8081:127.0.0.1:8081 kaung006@csel-kh1250-05.cselabs.umn.edu
    ```

2. Compile the project (within ssh session)

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/repo/project
    make -j
    ```
    
 3. Run project (within ssh session)

    ```bash
    ./build/bin/transit_service 8081 apps/transit_service/web/
    ```

5. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081 and you should see a visualization.

6. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081/schedule.html and you should see a page to schedule the trips.

## Using VOLE

1. See [here](https://github.umn.edu/umn-csci-3081-S23/FAQs/tree/main/VOLE) on how to start using VOLE.

2. Compile the project (within ssh session)

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/repo/project
    make -j
    ```
    
  3. Run project (within ssh session)

      ```bash
      ./build/bin/transit_service 8081 apps/transit_service/web/
      ```

  4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081 and you should see a visualization.

  5. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081/schedule.html and you should see a page to schedule the trips.
